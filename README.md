🌍 Industrial Carbon Emissions Analysis Using USEPA Data
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes industrial greenhouse gas emissions across the United States using publicly available USEPA data (2010–2022). The goal is to understand how emissions vary by industry, state, emission type, and time, and to extract actionable insights that can support environmental policy decisions, sustainability initiatives, and emission reduction strategies.

Data Source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
Time Period: 2010 – 2022
Tools Used: Tableau, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization

🎯 Problem Statement

Industrial greenhouse gas emissions significantly contribute to climate change and environmental health risks.
This project addresses the following questions:

How do emissions vary across industries and regions?
Which industries contribute the most to greenhouse gas emissions?
What emission trends exist over time?
How can these insights guide effective emission reduction strategies?

🧠 Business Understanding

Climate change mitigation requires data-driven decision-making. By analyzing industrial emissions across 70+ industries, 50 states, and multiple emission types, this project helps:
Identify high-impact industries
Highlight regions of concern
Support policy interventions and renewable energy strategies
Promote sustainable industrial growth

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains industrial-level emission information reported to the USEPA, including:
Industry classification (NAICS)
State and city information
Heat input capacity
Emission quantities by type
Reporting year

🔥 Emission Types Analyzed

Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)
CO₂ – Biogenic
Methane (CH₄)
Nitrous Oxide (N₂O)
Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)

🧹 Step-by-Step Project Workflow
✅ Step 1: Data Cleaning

Performed data preprocessing in Tableau:

Removed records with NULL values

FRS ID

Primary NAICS Code

Ensured consistency across years, industries, and states

✔ Result: Clean and reliable dataset for visualization and analysis.

📊 Step 2: Heat Input Capacity Analysis (Map Visualization)

Visualization: Heat Map (State-level)

What was done:

Analyzed maximum rated heat input capacity by state from 2010–2022

Identified geographic concentration of energy-intensive industries

Key Insights:

Texas (TX) has the highest heat input capacity

California (CA) and Louisiana (LA) also show consistently high values

Several states show a declining trend, indicating energy efficiency improvements

🔵 Step 3: Top Emission Industries (Bubble Chart)

Visualization: Bubble Chart

What was done:

Compared total emissions across industries over time

Key Insights:

Power Plants are the largest emitters

Petroleum & Natural Gas ranks second

Waste, Chemicals, and Minerals follow

Metals and Mining show relatively lower emissions

📈 Step 4: Methane (CH₄) Emissions Analysis

Visualization: Bar Chart

What was done:

Analyzed average annual methane emissions by industry and state

Key Insights:

Petroleum & Natural Gas, Chemicals, Power Plants, and Waste emit the most methane

Minerals and Metals show minimal and stable emissions

📊 Step 5: Nitrous Oxide (N₂O) Emissions Analysis

Visualization: Bar Chart

What was done:

Examined N₂O emissions across industries and time

Key Insights:

Power Plants, Waste, and Pulp & Paper industries dominate N₂O emissions

Metals and Minerals remain the lowest contributors

📉 Step 6: SO₂ Emissions Trend Analysis

Visualization: Line Charts

6.1 SO₂ Emissions by Industry

Highest emissions observed in 2011

Declining trend until 2020

Slight increase post-2020

6.2 SO₂ Emissions by Unit Type

Number of emitting unit types remained constant

Indicates emission reductions came from efficiency improvements, not fewer units

📌 Step 7: Business & Environmental Insights

CO₂ is the dominant greenhouse gas, far exceeding others

Power Plants significantly impact all emission types

Declining emission trends despite stable industry counts suggest:

Improved regulations

Cleaner technologies

Better emission controls

High-emission industries require targeted sustainability strategies

🌱 Key Takeaways

Power Plants are the primary contributors across emissions
Energy-intensive states require focused policy enforcement
Emission reduction is possible without reducing industrial output
Data supports policy-driven climate action and renewable energy adoption

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data visualization and exploratory analysis can uncover critical environmental insights. The findings support policymakers, environmental groups, and industries in designing effective carbon reduction strategies and promoting sustainable growth.
